## Project background
I intend to build a dashboard to visualize exchange rates for the Nigerian Naira which will also update in real-time as changes are made from the data source. The idea behind this is to collect Naira exchange rate data from CBN’s website, load the data into a database, and then build a dashboard. To make this work, I’m going to be needing the following:
1. A knowledge of Python
2. Knowledge of Web scraping
3. ETL basics
4. Integrating SQL with Python
5. Database Management
5. Data Visualization
6. Good knowledge of Power BI service
